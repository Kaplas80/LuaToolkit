# LuaToolkit

**[LuaToolkit](https://github.com/ferib/LuaToolkit/src/)** is a library for C# that aims for Obfuscation.

The toolset not only comes with a custonizable Obfuscator that supports a plugin framework, it also has features such as Decompiling and Disassembling of compiled Lua binary's.

For now, the LuaToolkit is **only** support **Lua version 5.1**.

## Examples
You can find a few examples in the ``demo/`` directory, one of the most intersting one is the [graph](https://github.com/ferib/LuaToolkit/demo/graph) example that renders a interactive visual representation of the Lua function it Decompiled.
