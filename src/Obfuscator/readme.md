# Obfuscator
The obfuscator is another big component of the project, we have a `LOPlugin` interface that is not yet developed properly. Once we get that done then we will be able to provide am easy interface to build Obfuscator Plugins on.

## Roadmap
Our goal is to create a basic framework that the obfuscator can use to target each Lua function individually with a couple of pre-defined settings that are unique to each plugin.
